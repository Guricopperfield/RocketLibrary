# About
``rocket`` is a very tiny C++ library to manage and operate with files easily.
# Usage
Just clone repository with 

```
git clone https://github.com/getsadzeg/rocket.git
```
Now copy file named `rocket.h` to your project and access it:

```cpp
#include "rocket.h"
```
then you can just call functions demonstrated in `main` source file.
